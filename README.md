Dress to Impress, by OpenNeo
============================================

(We call it "Impress" for short.)

A PHP5 app that allows users to preview how clothes and backgrounds will look
on their Neopets. Yes, Neopets. It just so happens to offer many great
opportunities for coding projects.

Currently we're in closed development until the project is ready to take
center-stage, but feel free to poke around, download a copy, and trace our
development process.

Impress is run by a very small, very new, in-house MVC framework named Pwnage,
whose contents are in the /pwnage/ directory. Feel free to take a look.
