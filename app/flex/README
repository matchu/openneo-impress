These are source files for the Dress to Impress outfit viewer Flex app.

To compile in a Linux environment, run ./compile_preview.sh

If you open the script, you'll see that all it does is save you the effort
of typing in the output file destination. In a Windows environment, you'd do
something like this:

mxmlc.exe preview.mxml -o ../../www/assets/swf/preview.swf
